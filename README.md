## 🧠 Techniques Used

### ✅ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

BankBot applies NLP methods to process and understand user input:

* Text preprocessing
* Tokenization
* Intent identification / FAQ matching
* Pattern and keyword-based understanding

### ✅ Prompt Engineering

To improve chatbot response quality (especially with LLMs), BankBot supports:

* Structured prompts
* Role-based instructions
* Context-aware reply generation

### ✅ LLM-based Text Generation

BankBot can integrate **transformer-based LLMs** for intelligent and human-like responses:

* More natural conversation flow
* Better response generation for varied user questions
* Enhanced accuracy compared to traditional rule-based FAQs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### ✅ Programming Language

* **Python 3.x**

### ✅ Libraries / Frameworks

* `nltk` (text processing)
* `scikit-learn` (classification, intent detection – optional)
* `transformers` (LLM / transformer integration – optional)
* `flask` (web app support – if UI is included)
* `json` (dataset storage)

### ✅ AI / ML Technologies

* NLP-based intent recognition
* FAQ response mapping
* Transformer-based LLM support

---

## 🤖 LLM Details

This project supports **Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as:

* GPT-style models
* BERT-style transformer models (for classification / understanding)
* Hugging Face transformer models

✅ **Configurable LLM Support**
The LLM used in this chatbot is **configurable**, meaning you can switch between different transformer models depending on availability and requirements.
